# GPT Chatbot in VSCode Extension API
This is a GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) chatbot implemented in the VSCode Extension API. The chatbot is designed to provide users with a conversational interface that can interact with the VSCode editor.

## Features
The GPT chatbot in the VSCode Extension API has several features that make it a useful tool for developers. Here are some of the key features:

Conversational interface: The chatbot provides a conversational interface that allows users to interact with the VSCode editor in a natural language way.
Customizable responses: The chatbot can be customized to provide different responses based on the user's input. For example, the chatbot can provide different responses based on the programming language being used.
Integration with VSCode: The chatbot is integrated with the VSCode editor, allowing users to interact with the editor in real-time.
Integration with other APIs: The chatbot can be integrated with other APIs to provide more advanced functionality. For example, the chatbot can be integrated with a code completion API to provide suggestions for code completion.
How it works
The GPT chatbot in the VSCode Extension API works by using the OpenAI API to generate responses to user input. The chatbot is trained on a large dataset of text, including code snippets, to provide accurate and relevant responses.

When the user interacts with the chatbot, the VSCode Extension API sends the user's input to the chatbot. The chatbot then uses the OpenAI API to generate a response based on the user's input. The response is then sent back to the VSCode Extension API, which displays the response in the editor.

> User can also ask questions from the selected code in am active window of any language.

## Conclusion
The GPT chatbot in the VSCode Extension API is a useful tool for developers who want to interact with the VSCode editor in a natural language way. The chatbot provides a conversational interface that allows users to interact with the editor in real-time, and can be customized to provide different responses based on the user's input. The chatbot is trained on a large dataset of text, including code snippets, to provide accurate and relevant responses.
